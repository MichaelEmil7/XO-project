 # XO-Project

A simple browser-based XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This is a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O).

Interactive game board.

Game logic to determine a win or a draw.

Responsive and minimal UI.

Built using fundamental web technologies.

## Live Preview

You can run the game locally by simply opening the xo.html file in your browser after cloning the repository.

## Technologies Used

HTML for game structure.

CSS for styling.

JavaScript for game mechanics.

## Project Structure

XO-project :

- xo.html      # main HTML file

- xo.css       # styles for layout and visuals

- xo.js        # game logic

## How to Run

Clone the repository to your local machine:

## Game Rules

The grid consists of 9 cells (3×3).

Player X always goes first.

Players alternate placing their symbol in any empty cell.

The first player to place three of their symbols in a continuous line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) wins.

If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
